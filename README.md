# License-plate-Detection

## Transfer Learning with mobilenet for license plate bounding box regression task

### Run the generate_dataset.py to generate cropped images with respective transformations
### The code crops the original 1980 x 1080 into 512x512 images and transforms the annotations for the same.

### Dataset used is the UFPR - ALPR dataset. (Dataset is not present in the repo)

### Further changes with respect to model architecture and adding an OCR architecture for License plate text recognition have to be made.
