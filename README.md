# License-plate-Detection

## Transfer Learning with imagenet models for Vehicle and License plate detection task.

### Run the generate_dataset.py to generate cropped images with respective transformations
### The code crops the original 1980 x 1080 into 512x512 images and transforms the annotations for the same.
